# IDBS Developer Assessment Application

Welcome to the IDBS Developer Assessment Application github repository.

The purpose for this repo is to provide access for ***invited candidates*** to our coding assessment application. 

If you **have been invited** to complete the code assessment phase of our software developer  application process then please continue. If you have **not** been invited, we are sorry but we cannot accept developer assessment solutions from anybody other than those we have invited through our application process. If you are interested in applying to IDBS for a software developer position please visit:

# Getting Started

### Step One - download folder for your selected language
As discussed in the screening interview, the coding assessment can be completed in various programming languages. Please select your preferred language (as agreed in the screening interview) and download the associated folder to your local environment.

***A note on forking:*** it is best NOT to fork the repository. By forking the repo you will create another ***public repo*** that all other candidates can see and use. Sharing your solution in this way is non-ideal for your application process.

### Step Two - develop your solution
Please read and follow the instruction in the file *Scenario Description.txt* in your selected language folder.
