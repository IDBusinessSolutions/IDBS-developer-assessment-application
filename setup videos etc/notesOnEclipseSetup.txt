0.1) Everything demonstrated is Windows based. If you are using a linux system you'll need to adapt the instructions for linux

0.2) We use github (https://github.com) as the source of the coding assessment exercise and also as the method for YOU to deliver your completed solution to us.
	- As such we will need a github account. 
	- If you do not yet have a github account simply setup one up on github - it is free of charge.
	

1) Getting the Assessment exercise from github (the codebase)
	- download the application from github
	- use the MASTER branch of the repo: https://github.com/IDBusinessSolutions/IDBS-developer-assessment-application
	- either clone the repo OR download the code as a zip file
	
	a) To clone the repo:
		- You'll need gitbash (or similar) installed for this - I have gitbash installed (available from the web) - adds a context menu option in explorer  
		- in explorer - right click the target folder - open "gitbash here"
		- in the gitbash command window type: "git clone" <paste the url of the repo copied from github>
		- The repo is cloned to your machine
		
	b) using the zip download option
		- in github - select Code/download zip
		- cut&paste the zip to the target folder
		- extract the zip file (e.g. using 7-zip)
		
2) Now you have applications codebase and reference jars files on your machine. You now need to create a JAVA project in eclipse in order to develop your solution. 
	- This will be the project in which you develop your solution, this is a plain java project.
	
	a) The code has been downloaded to your target folder
	b) There are many ways to create a project in eclipse. We will right-click on the "Working Set" I have called "Student Assessment Space" and select New/Java Project
	c) Provide a project name of your choice
	d) MOST IMPORTANTLY deselect the "Use Default Location" checkbox. You need to tell eclipse to load the code from the folder containing the code from github (in the previous step)
		- deselect the check box
		- hit browser button and select the folder where you have put the code + reference libraries from github.
	e) JRE setting: the java runtime environment (version of java) needs to be java 8; this is because the libraries supplied are compiled to java-8. 
- Ensure java-8 is selected for this project
- You may experience unusual compilation or runtime issues if you do not use java-8. Having said this if you do not, we are absolutely OK with a more recent version of java.		
	f) Hit finish and the project should be created.
	
3) Now you need to execute the application. The main() for the application (java's "entry" execution point), is located in the reference library: IDBSDeveloperAssessment.jar. To execute the main() method:
	a) in eclipse's "package explorer" view - expand the project created & expand the reference library "folder"
	c) right click on the reference library "IDBSDeveloperAssessment" - select Run As/Java Application
		- this will run the application - the assessment application window will appear in the centre of the screen
		- behind the scenes it also create a “Run configuration” which can be used to executes the application again and again (via the green “start” icon or the green “debug” icon)
	d) all instructions on how to begin development are provided within the application itself via the "Task Details" and "Integration Details" button.
	e) as explained in the instructions your starting for coding purposes is the class "CandidateSolution" found in the package "com.idbs.devassessment.solution" under the "src" folder.
		- the code supplied is an example, you should use this as a starting point.
