# Java Based Assessment Exercise

Energy consumption POC. 

Objective of exercise
 =====================
 - The POC application can be executed and provides a set of calculated energy usage and a pass/fail result (i.e. it is self-testing)
 - The POC code is NOT at the standard required for a production system.
 - You are tasked with refactoring this code to be closer to production level code
 - We would like you to start refactoring the method TransformEnergyDataToStandardDataStore_POC.loadDataFromFeed(String dataFeed)
 
For further information please read ***Scenario Description.txt***

Download code, integrate into you IDE & execute.

expected output is...
```
Calculated energy used at Waterloo Office is: 9.57 Kw     (expected: 9.57 Kw)
Calculated energy used at Guildford Office is: 209.31 Kw     (expected: 209.31 Kw)
Calculated energy used at Portland Maine Office is: 387.13 Kw     (expected: 387.13 Kw)
Calculated energy used at Alemeda California Office is: 4651.63 Kw     (expected: 4651.63 Kw)


TEST PASS: all values as expected
