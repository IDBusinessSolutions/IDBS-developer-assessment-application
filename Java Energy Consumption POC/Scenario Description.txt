The POC developed for this exercise has the following scenario
==============================================================

 - A large international company has many offices around the world
 - The head office want to monitor and track energy usage within their individual offices
 - They have purchased thousands of small electrical monitoring devices and deployed these to each office around the world.
 - Each device measures the energy usage of an electrical appliance to which it is attached.
 - Electrical usage data is sent from each office to a central system where it is collected and made available for statistical analysis.
  
 - The POC we have supplied reads this data for 4 representative offices, Guildford, Waterloo, Portland-Maine & Alameda. 
 - Each office provides data for many devices with the following information provided for each electrical appliance.
	- Date & Time of the energy reading
	- Unique Identifier for the electrical appliance 
	- The energy consumption of the electrical appliance (in watts per hour)
	- The number of seconds the appliance was switch-on (in seconds)
	
 - The exact format of the data provided by each office may be different, but the key elements of the data (described above) will remain the same.
 - We have provided four formats but in reality there are likely to be many more formats from other offices.


 Objective of exercise
 =====================
 - The POC application can be executed and provides a set of calculated energy usage and a pass/fail result (i.e. it is self-testing)
 - The POC code is NOT at the standard required for a production system.
 - You are tasked with refactoring this code to be closer to production level code
 - We would like you to start refactoring the method TransformEnergyDataToStandardDataStore_POC.loadDataFromFeed(String dataFeed)
 
 
 - PLEASE DO NOT MAKE CODE CHANGES BEFORE THE INTERVIEW...we'd like to work with you during the interview to discuss and make changes
 - DO NOT REFACTOR CLASSES in the com.idbs.simpleassessment.poc.livefeed package or the com.idbs.simpleassessment.poc.test
