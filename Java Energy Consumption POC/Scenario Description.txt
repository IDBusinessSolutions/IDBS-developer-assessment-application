The POC developed for this exercise has the following scenario
==============================================================

 - THIS IS A FICTIONAL SCENARIO...
 - A large international company has many offices around the world
 - The head office want to monitor and track energy usage within their individual offices
 - They have purchased thousands of small electrical monitoring devices and deployed these to each office around the world.
 - Each device measures the energy usage of a single electrical appliance to which it is attached.
 - Electrical usage data for each appliance is collected at the given office and is then sent from that office to a central system where it is read and made available for statistical analysis.
  
 - The POC we have supplied READS this data for 4 representative offices, Woking, Waterloo, Portland & Alameda. 
 - Each office provides data for many devices at the location, with the following information provided for each electrical appliance.
	- Date & Time of the energy reading
	- Unique Identifier for the electrical appliance 
	- The energy consumption of the electrical appliance (in watts per hour)
	- The number of seconds the appliance was switch-on (in seconds)
	
 - The exact format of the data provided by each office may be different, but the key elements of the data (described above) will remain the same.
 - IMPORTANT: we have provided four example formats but in reality there are likely to be many more formats from other offices.


 Objective of exercise
 =====================
 - You are tasked with refactoring this code to be closer to production level code
 - The POC code is NOT at the standard required for a production system.
  
 - We would like you to start refactoring the method TransformEnergyDataToStandardDataStore_POC.loadDataFromFeed(String dataFeed)
  
 - PLEASE DO NOT MAKE CODE CHANGES BEFORE THE INTERVIEW...we'd like to work with you during the interview to discuss and make changes
 - DO NOT REFACTOR CLASSES in the com.idbs.simpleassessment.poc.livefeed package or the com.idbs.simpleassessment.poc.test

 
 When Refactoring
 ================
 - The code provided for this exercise can be executed. This execution can be used to test your refactored code.
 - Execution of the code (and thus the test) is via the main method within the class POC_EntryPoint
 - If your refactoring changes how the data is read it will fail the test and highlighted in the execution output thus:
 
FAILED TEST  ====== FAILED TEST  ====== FAILED TEST  ====== FAILED TEST  ====== FAILED TEST  ====== 
FAILED TEST  ======                                                             FAILED TEST  ====== 
FAILED TEST  ======              some calculated values were not correct        FAILED TEST  ====== 
FAILED TEST  ======                                                             FAILED TEST  ====== 
FAILED TEST  ====== FAILED TEST  ====== FAILED TEST  ====== FAILED TEST  ====== FAILED TEST  ======
