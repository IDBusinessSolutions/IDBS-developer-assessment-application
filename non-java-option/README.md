# non-java Developer Assessment Application

This section of the assessment repo is for those candidates that have been invited to submit the exercise in a coding language other than Java.

The option to submit via a coding lanaguage other than java will have been discussed during your interview - so if you are not sure if this applies to you, it probably does not. In which case please return to the root of the repo and complete the exercise in java and submit to us when complete.

If we discussed completing the assessment exercise in a language other than java (python, C++ or C#) please read on for instructions.

## Instructions
There are two folder in this section, one for each level of difficulty (Level-1 & Level-2). Each folder has a README.md file providing the detailed instructions for the given level and a data file containing the input data youâ€™ll need to programmatically load into your solution.

There is also a section providing instructions on how to submit your completed exercise (Submission Instructions).
