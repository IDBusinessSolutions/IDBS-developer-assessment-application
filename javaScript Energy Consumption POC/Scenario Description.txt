The POC developed for this exercise has the following scenario
==============================================================

 - A large international company has many offices around the world
 - The head office want to monitor and track energy usage within their individual offices
 - They have purchased thousands of small electrical monitoring devices and deployed these to each office around the world.
 - Each device measures the energy usage of an electrical appliance to which it is attached.
 - Electrical usage data is sent from each office to a central system where it is collected and made available for statistical analysis.
  
 - The POC we have supplied reads this data for 4 representative offices, Guildford, Waterloo, Portland (maine) and Alameda. 
 - Each office provides data for many devices with the following information provided for each electrical appliance.
	- Date & Time of the energy reading
	- Unique Identifier for the electrical appliance 
	- The energy consumption of the electrical appliance (in watts per hour)
	- The number of seconds the appliance was switch-on (in seconds)
	
 - The exact format of the data provided by each office is different, but the key elements of the data (described above) will remain the same.
 - We have provided four formats in this POC but in reality there are likely to be many more formats as each office defines its own format via its transmission mechanism.


 Objective of exercise
 =====================
 - The POC application can be executed and provides a set of calculated energy usage values and a pass/fail result incorporating all of the office's data (i.e. it is self-testing)
 - The POC code is NOT at the standard required for a production system.
 - You are tasked with refactoring this code to be closer to production level code
 
 - PLEASE DO NOT MAKE CODE CHANGES BEFORE THE INTERVIEW...we'd like to work with you during the interview to discuss and make changes
