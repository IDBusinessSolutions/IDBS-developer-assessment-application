# Getting Started

### Step One - download
Download this repository to your local environment - either clone or download a zip of the repo.

***A note on forking:*** it is best NOT to fork the repository. By forking the repo you will create another ***public repo*** that all other candidates can see and use. Sharing your solution in this way is non-ideal for your application process.

### Step Two - write some python
All instructions on how to develop your application are provided in the *Assessment Exercise Python Instructions.pdf* file. Essentually we have generated two sets of input data, one for difficulty Level_1 the other for Level_2. The input files are zipped up. Please follow the instructions and "rules" for the assessment exercise provided in the pdf.

If you have any questions or problems please reach out to us via the email providing the link to this repo.


### Step Three - submit your solution
Once you have developed your python solution to level-2, your solution works and you are happy with the quality of your code. You are ready to submit your solution to us for assessment. You will find submission details within the instructions.
